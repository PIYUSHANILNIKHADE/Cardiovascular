# Cardiovascular
The Cardiovascular Disease Detection Model is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict heart disease by analyzing key blood report parameters and other body-related metrics. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early disease detection and preventive care.

⚙️ How It Works
The model collects user inputs based on relevant health parameters.
The trained machine learning model processes the inputs.
It provides a probability score indicating the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
Based on the probability, the system recommends further medical advice or potential medications.
